# Train Delay Analysis and Prediction

This repository was initially created for a position at Ypto and later updated for a test with DTSC. It contains data analysis and a predictive model to understand and anticipate train delays using historical data from Infrabel's open data.

## Repository Contents

The repository is organized as follows:

- **Notebooks**:  
  Contains two Jupyter notebooks with analyses focused on identifying the various causes of train delays.
  
- **Data**:  
  A folder where all the datasets used for the analysis and modeling are stored.

- **src**:  
  This folder contains the scripts for the different analyses as well as the code for building a model to predict train delays.

- **ref_papers**:  
  A collection of state-of-the-art papers from other countries addressing similar problems related to train delays.

- **requirements.txt**:  
  A file listing all the dependencies required to set up the appropriate environment for reproducing the results.

- **Test_Data_Scientist_Yassine_ZAIM.pptx**:  
  A presentation of the results initially prepared for Ypto, but also relevant for DTSC, as both analyses use Infrabel's open data.

## Setup Instructions

To reproduce the analysis and model predictions, follow the steps below:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:ZaimYassine/Ypto-test-Yassine-Zaim.git
   cd Ypto-test-Yassine-Zaim
   pip install -r requirements.txt
